The year 2021 is coming to a close soon. I have bben thinking through my reading habit that I set up at the beggining of the year and evaluating how it has worked out so far. All of my reading is non-fiction and is mostly books on what I could call 'expert takes on a topics'. For instance, some of the books I ought have completed this year range from topics such as economics, hostory, business and personal development. To be more specific, I had in my list; _Basic Economics_ (T. Sowell), _Guns, Germs and Steel_(Jared Diamond), _The Obstacle is the Way_(Ryan Holiday) and a re-read of _Atomic Habits_ (James Clear). I set out with this list with the intention of getting as much practical knowledge on the topics as I could from the authors.

I did not manage to get through this list and my initial reaction while reviewing the list was disappointment at the failure. However, another thought came to mind at the moment and I asked myself, _Of the books that I have read, to what extent have I put into action the key take-aways from the author?_. This was a rather unsettling thought considering that I have always assumed that I internalize the contents of the books just by reading. Sure, I have taken some sketchy notes as I read but it still bothers me that I have not consiously considered acting out, at least as a test, the ideas of any book I have read so far. For instance, in 2019, I recall reading _Deep Work_, taking some notes, highlighting pages and pausing to reflect. But I did not setout to practically test the concepts. Eventually, it just became a book the I have read and not had any usefull impact in my daily life.

As I get started into 2022, I am planning to have a better strategy at internalizing what I read and as much as possible, making the reading relevant in daily life. Obviously this is not applicable in all situations for instance; if I am reading _Guns Germs and Steel_(a book that generally about how different groups of people got to where they are today in advancements), how much practical knowledge can I take away? Not much. But atleast I should be able to come out with a solid idea of the author's core ideas and from that introspect, critique and relate that to today's state of the world. At the very least this knowledge would be useful at understanding related outcomes in other similar localized or global situations. 

I have not thought of having any extra 'tools' that I have come accross to help me in my reading but I definitely intend to make it a more deliberate process and get as much as I can out out of it. Coincedentally this afternoon as I drove to town wher e I am witing this, I was listening to a podcast about a guy with a library of more than 60,000 books and he was explaining how he learnt how to get the most of his reads. He mention something called 'Systems Thinking' which I looked up understood that the key idea is getting the ideas in the book and relating them with other ideas or concepts and then trying to get a clearer picture from the reading. 

So for this coming year, I will attempt to read more deliberately and test out the the practical ideas in guides to the extent applicable. I do not yet have a way of measuring results towards the end of the year but I think a decent way of making sure I have tested out the ideas in a book is by documenting and applying applications in whatever way and extent they are. I will probably do this on Evernote and measure how it works out. At some point later this year, I will document my progress.
